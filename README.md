Hello.

I am studying Computer Science at A level (the equivalent to an american High School). Essentially, i am hoping to start flight training once a finish, and as part of my qualification i need to make a program that uses databases and some other stuff. my project is a flight logging and monitoring system for use by operations teams at airlines.

my project seeks to streamline the collection and storage of data pertaining to to each pilot, aircraft and flight. this data is then used to show statistics and keep logs. i am attempting to use API's despite not having been taught how to use them yet. i would like to use an API to gather information about an aircraft from only its tail number (Like an API equivalent to G-INFO from the Civil Aviation Authority) and to plot aircraft locations on a map, like flightRadar24 an similar websites.
